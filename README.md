## Inspiration 🤩
I love discovering and trying varieties of food [except shrimp 😅] I use reddit a lot but never wondered how it was built, to solve my curiosity I decided to build a minimal and simple duiscussion board application, hence the birth of Fooddit. <br> P.S.- I had a great learning curve working on this project.

## Installation 🛠️
1. Install ![ng](https://nodejs.org/en/)

2. Intstall angular cli :

    ```$ npm install -g @angular/cli```

3. Import the angular code

## Build and Run 🚀
1. Angular (Front-end)
    1.1. To Build :

    ```$ ng build```
    
    1.2. To Run :

    ```$ ng serve```
    
    1.3. Production build :

    ```$ ng build --prod```
    
2. Spring MVC (Back-end)
    2.1. Make sure MySQL is running(refer resources for tutorial).
 
    2.2. Import springmvc into your IDE of choice and install required dependencies using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/), then run the application.
        2.2.1. if you don't have maven installed, [install maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) 

Note: Angular will be running on: localhost4200; Springmvc will be running on: localhost8080. (unless if the port is manually configured or if something is already in use of that ports).
