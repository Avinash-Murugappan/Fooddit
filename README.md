## Inspiration 🤩
I love discovering and trying varieties of food [except shrimp 😅] I use reddit a lot but never wondered how it was built, to solve my curiosity I decided to build a minimal and simple duiscussion board application, hence the birth of Fooddit. P.S.- I had a great learning curve working on this project.
